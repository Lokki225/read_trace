    <!-- Code Quality Deep Dive -->
    <action>For EACH file in comprehensive review list:
      1. **Security**: Look for injection risks, missing validation, auth issues
      2. **Performance**: N+1 queries, inefficient loops, missing caching
      3. **Error Handling**: Missing try/catch, poor error messages
      4. **Code Quality**: Complex functions, magic numbers, poor naming
      5. **Test Quality**: Are tests real assertions or placeholders?

      ## 🔴 CRITICAL ISSUES
      - Tasks marked [x] but not actually implemented
      - Acceptance Criteria not implemented
      - Story claims files exist but files not found
      - Security vulnerabilities

      ## 🟡 MEDIUM ISSUES
      - Files exist but not documented in story File List
      - Implementation files not tracked
      - Performance problems
      - Poor test coverage/quality
      - Code maintainability issues
