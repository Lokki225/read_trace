# Story 1.6: create-ai-workflows-and-project-rules

Status: ready-for-dev

<!-- Note: Validation is optional. Run validate-create-story for quality check before dev-story. -->

## Story

As an AI agent,
I want to create enhanced AI workflows and project rules with AI Constitution bootstrap,
So that AI agents can work autonomously while following all governance requirements.

## Acceptance Criteria

**Given** the test infrastructure is configured
**When** I create AI workflows and project rules
**Then** .windsurf/workflows/ exists with continue-implementation.md including AI Constitution bootstrap
**And** validate-implementation.md exists with confidence guard integration
**And** smart-implementation.md exists with anti-simplification enforcement
**And** confidence-guard.md exists for protecting confidence scores
**And** product-alignment.md exists for strategic validation
**And** auto-healing.md exists for proactive fixes
**And** .windsurfrules exists with AI Constitution reference and all BMAD rules
**And** all workflows include mandatory AI Constitution bootstrap sequences

## Tasks / Subtasks

- [ ] Task 1: Create core AI workflows (AC: #1, #2, #3)
  - [ ] Subtask 1.1: Create .windsurf/workflows/ directory
  - [ ] Subtask 1.2: Create continue-implementation.md with AI Constitution bootstrap
  - [ ] Subtask 1.3: Create validate-implementation.md with confidence guard integration
- [ ] Task 2: Implement specialized workflows (AC: #4, #5, #6)
  - [ ] Subtask 2.1: Create smart-implementation.md with anti-simplification enforcement
  - [ ] Subtask 2.2: Create confidence-guard.md for protecting confidence scores
  - [ ] Subtask 2.3: Create product-alignment.md for strategic validation
- [ ] Task 3: Setup auto-healing and project rules (AC: #7, #8)
  - [ ] Subtask 3.1: Create auto-healing.md for proactive fixes
  - [ ] Subtask 3.2: Create .windsurfrules with AI Constitution reference
  - [ ] Subtask 3.3: Add all BMAD rules to .windsurfrules
- [ ] Task 4: Ensure bootstrap compliance (AC: #9)
  - [ ] Subtask 4.1: Add AI Constitution bootstrap to all workflows
  - [ ] Subtask 4.2: Test workflow bootstrap sequences
  - [ ] Subtask 4.3: Validate governance compliance across all workflows

## Dev Notes

- **AI Constitution Bootstrap**: All workflows MUST start with AI Constitution reference
- **Confidence Guard Protection**: Prevents confidence score degradation below 90
- **Anti-Simplification Enforcement**: Prevents cutting corners that harm quality
- **Product Alignment**: Validates all implementation against Product Layer specifications
- **Auto-Healing**: Proactive identification and fixing of common issues
- **BMAD Rules Enforcement**: .windsurfrules contains all architectural and quality requirements

### Project Structure Notes

- **Alignment with unified project structure**: Creates .windsurf/ directory for AI workflow governance
- **Detected conflicts or variances**: None - essential for AI agent governance
- **Integration Point**: Referenced by IDE and all AI agents for execution rules
