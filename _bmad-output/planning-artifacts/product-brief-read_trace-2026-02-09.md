# Product Brief: read_trace

## Executive Summary

ReadTrace is a reading continuity system that solves the core problem of fragmented reading memory for heavy manga/manhwa consumers. Unlike traditional bookmark or tracking tools, ReadTrace preserves narrative continuity and emotional connection across multiple platforms and devices. By automatically detecting reading progress and providing contextual memory assistance, ReadTrace eliminates the friction that causes readers to abandon series, transforming the cognitive burden of "where was I?" into seamless one-click story resumption.

---

## Core Vision

### Problem Statement

Modern readers consume serialized stories across fragmented platforms, but they lack a personal system to preserve continuity, context, and emotional connection over time. Heavy readers juggling 10-50+ series across multiple scan sites lose track of not just chapter numbers, but the narrative context and emotional state that makes returning to stories effortless. This fragmentation creates cognitive friction that kills reading habits and leads to abandoned series.

### Problem Impact

The impact extends far beyond forgotten chapter numbers. Readers experience:
- Loss of narrative continuity and emotional connection to stories
- Cognitive burden of rereading chapters to regain context
- Guilt and frustration over dropped series
- Fragmented reading experience across devices and platforms
- Decline in reading consistency and habit formation

### Why Existing Solutions Fall Short

Current solutions fail because they treat reading continuity as a bookmark problem rather than a memory problem. Browser bookmarks, spreadsheets, and generic tracking apps lack:
- Automatic progress detection across multiple sites
- Contextual memory and narrative assistance
- Cross-device synchronization
- Story-aware design for serialized content
- Habit support and re-engagement features

### Proposed Solution

ReadTrace is a reading memory assistant that automatically tracks progress across any manga/manhwa site and preserves the narrative context needed for seamless story re-entry. The system detects title, chapter, and page position automatically, then provides a unified dashboard where readers can resume any series with one click. Future AI integration will deliver story recaps and character context to bridge memory gaps completely.

### Key Differentiators

ReadTrace's competitive advantage stems from solving continuity rather than tracking:
- **Memory-First Architecture**: Built to preserve narrative continuity, not just save locations
- **Site-Aware Auto-Detection**: Proprietary parsing engine that works across dozens of scan sites
- **Continuity Engine**: Focus on emotional and cognitive re-entry into stories
- **Cross-Platform Memory**: Unified reading brain that works anywhere users read
- **AI-Powered Context**: Future capability to summarize arcs and reconstruct story memory

## Target Users

### Primary Users

**Alex the Heavy Binger** - Age 22, university student/early-career worker who reads 30+ ongoing series across 5+ scan sites. Alex experiences the most acute pain from lost continuity, frequently abandoning series due to the mental effort required to resume reading. Key behaviors include multi-device reading, binge sessions, and frustration with manual tracking methods. Alex's "aha!" moment comes when returning after a break and receiving instant resume with contextual recap, eliminating the need to reread chapters.

**Sam the Casual Returner** - Reads 3-10 series sporadically, often dropping series for months. Sam's primary pain point is emotional disconnection from stories after long breaks, leading to series abandonment. Sam values contextual recaps and "previously on..." summaries that bridge memory gaps and reduce the friction of returning to paused stories.

### Secondary Users

**Jordan the Community Reader** - Engages heavily in forums, Discord, and fan communities. Jordan needs to track progress to avoid spoilers and participate meaningfully in discussions. Values tagging features, character/arc tracking, and social visibility of reading habits.

**Friends/Social Influencers** - Recommend series within peer groups and benefit from shared reading lists and progress visibility. Drive adoption through social proof and community endorsement.

**Content Creators/Scanlation Groups** - Benefit from aggregated reading analytics and engagement insights to understand reader behavior and improve content delivery.

### User Journey

**Discovery Phase:** Users discover ReadTrace through social channels (Discord recommendations, Reddit discussions, community forums) where peers share solutions to fragmented reading problems. Initial curiosity is sparked by promises of eliminating manual tracking.

**Onboarding Experience:** Quick 2-minute setup flow connecting favorite scan sites, optional import of existing bookmarks/spreadsheets, and preference configuration. Focus on minimal friction to prevent abandonment during first use.

**Initial Use & "Aha!" Moment:** First-time users experience auto-save functionality during normal reading. The breakthrough moment occurs when returning after a break and receiving instant resume with contextual recap, restoring emotional continuity without mental effort.

**Habit Formation:** Daily integration through breakfast checks for new chapters, break-time reading sessions, and evening binge sessions. Behavior shifts from manual tracking to effortless continuity, with users reading more consistently across multiple series and abandoning fewer titles.

**Long-term Retention:** Different retention drivers for each persona - Alex values habitual heavy reading support, Sam appreciates break-return assistance, Jordan leverages community engagement features. All users benefit from reduced cognitive load and restored reading enjoyment.
